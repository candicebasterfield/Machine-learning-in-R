# Machine-learning-in-R
#### **Overview**
In this project, I used a wide array of baseline predictors (N=80), including psychological, social, biological, sociodemographic and health variables, from a publicly available dataset, Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS), to predict the course of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) over 9 years.

#### Variables 
###### Predictors 
At baseline, a wide array of predictors was included, clinical, psychological, sociodemographic, biological, and lifestyle, making up 80 variables.  

*Sociodemographic Factors: Age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, and education.

*Life Challenges: Daily stressors (e.g., work overload, family arguments, traffic problems), chronic stressors (e.g., caregiving, perceived discrimination, perceived inequalities,  work-family spillover, childcare difficulties, unemployment), acute events (e.g., divorce, remarriage, job change, deaths, relocation).

*Health Behaviors: Smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, substance abuse, hormone therapy, preventive healthcare, alternative healthcare.

*Psychological: Personality, affect, coping, control, goal orientations, optimism, religion/spirituality, and health beliefs.

*Social: Social support, spousal relations, parent-child ties, childhood violence, social participation, social responsibility, job characteristics, and neighborhood quality.

*Health/Illness: Mental (depression, anxiety, psychological well-being, and cognitive function); physical (subjective health, health comparisons, chronic conditions, symptoms.

*Disability/Functional Limitations, and Mortality

#### Analyses

Two machine learning models, gradient boosted trees, and elastic nets were compared to predict clinical courses in patients with GAD at 9-year follow-up:
*Gradient boosted trees:
*Elastic nets: 
*Logistic regression was run with overlapping predictors from gradient boosted trees and elastic nets
